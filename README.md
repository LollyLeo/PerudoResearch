These are the notebooks with training and in-consol testing of the models. The models themselves are too heavy for github
Achieved Results:
1 cube:
    mccfr: 
        exploitability = 0.038
        time ≈ 5m
        iterations ≈ 20k
    CFR+:
        exploitability = 0.025
        time ≈ 5m
        iterations = 100
